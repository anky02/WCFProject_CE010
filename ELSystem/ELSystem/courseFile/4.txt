The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default. In other words, it is the topmost class of java.

The Object class is beneficial if you want to refer any object whose type you don't know. Notice that parent class reference variable can refer the child class object, know as upcasting.

Let's take an example, there is getObject() method that returns an object but it can be of any type like Employee,Student etc, we can use Object class reference to refer that object. For example:

Object obj=getObject();//we don't know what object will be returned from this method  
The Object class provides some common behaviors to all the objects such as object can be compared, object can be cloned, object can be notified etc.
